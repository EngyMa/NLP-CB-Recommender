# NLP-CB-Recommender
### The Hybrid Recommender System uses both visual & textual content to give the best recommendations

#### An example dataset (IMDB) movie dataset is used to highlight the capabilities of such solution

Such Content-based systems are suitable for the cold-start problem in product catalogues: when you have no prior data on user demand or preferences

This repot contains both a jupyter notebook of the NLP solution and a simplified flask app to test and play with the solution
